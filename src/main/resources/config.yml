# HomePlugin Configuration

# Default max homes (used if player has no permission nodes)
max-homes: 5

# Teleport delay in seconds (0 for instant teleport)
teleport-delay: 3

# Permission-based home limits:
# Give players permission nodes like:
#   homeplugin.homes.3  = 3 homes
#   homeplugin.homes.10 = 10 homes
#   homeplugin.homes.25 = 25 homes
# If a player has multiple permissions, only the HIGHEST will be used
# Example: Player with both homeplugin.homes.3 and homeplugin.homes.10 gets 10 homes
